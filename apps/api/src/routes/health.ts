// Answers what is running as well as whether it is running. The branch and
// commit are what tell two checkouts serving two ports apart in development,
// and what names the deployed build in production without reading a workflow
// log. Both are public and the commit is short: seven characters identify the
// build to someone who already has the repository, and little to anyone else.
//
// The database round trip is the point of the readiness half. Reporting ok
// without it puts a pod that cannot serve a single request back into the load
// balancer's rotation. Liveness is a TCP check rather than this one, so a
// database outage takes replicas out of rotation without restart-looping the
// whole deployment — infra/k8s/deployment.yaml says so at the probes.
