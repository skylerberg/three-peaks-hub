// listed for is a consequence of it rather than a separate test:
//
//   owed = quantity - (copies already printed at this card's current artwork,
//                      with the reverse the deck currently gives it)

// re-imported has none at the new version; a card whose deck was given a new
// back has none with that back on it; and a card whose copy count went up has
// some but not enough. Four situations, one subtraction -- which is what keeps
// the number on the screen and the cards on the sheet from disagreeing.
//
// Copies accumulate across runs deliberately. Printing the two a deck is short
// and then asking again has to say zero, or every partial run would ask for the
