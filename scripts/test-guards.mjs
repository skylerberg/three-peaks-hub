// Mutation testing. Each entry names a bug and the exact edit that puts it
// back; the runner requires the named tests to FAIL with that edit in place.
//
// This exists because a unit test can measure nothing and still report green --
// a stale expectation, a fixture that stopped reaching the code path, an
// assertion that was already true before the fix. A guard whose tests still
// pass has stopped guarding anything, and nothing else in the repo can tell you
// that.
//
// Rules for adding one:
//   * `find` must match EXACTLY ONCE in the file. A pattern that matches
//     nothing leaves the source correct and the tests green, which is
//     indistinguishable from a guard that works.
//   * `testName` should be narrow enough that exactly one case fails. A widened
//     name can turn a five-second failure into a run with no upper bound.
//   * The bug should be one a reviewer would plausibly introduce, not a
//     syntactic nonsense that fails to compile.
