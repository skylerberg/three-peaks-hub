// Every `check:*` script has to be run by something. `check:all` is the gate a
// person runs; the workflows are the gate a push runs; a check in neither is a
// file nobody executes.
//
// This exists because that is not hypothetical. check:upload, check:model3d and
// check:a11y were each written with a --selftest arm and a documented "fails
// under CI rather than skipping" contract, and for a year no workflow ran any of
// them -- so the contract never once executed, and the flake in one of them
// survived every green build.
//
// The failure mode is specific to a hand-copied list: check:all names its steps
// in package.json and the workflows name theirs again in YAML, so adding a
// twelfth check to one leaves the other with eleven and nothing says so.
