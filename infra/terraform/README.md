# Infrastructure

Everything below lives in the existing `realm-construction` GCP project and the
existing `cow-cluster` GKE cluster. State is in `gs://cow-terraform-state` under
the `three-peaks-hub` prefix.

## Current state (2026-08-21)

**The site is live at https://tools.threepeaksgames.com.** `terraform apply` has
run in full (27 resources), the managed certificate for the apex is ACTIVE, both
API replicas are HEALTHY in the load balancer's NEG, and the SPA is served from
the bucket with the API on the same origin. Uploads go to GCS through Workload
Identity with no key file anywhere.

Everything under "First-time bootstrap" is done. What is left is previews only:

- `three-peaks-hub-wildcard-cert` is **PROVISIONING** and will stay that way
  until the DNS-01 CNAME under "Enabling preview subdomains" is published in
  Route 53. Until then `pr-<n>.tools.threepeaksgames.com` has no certificate,
  and `attach_wildcard_cert_map` must stay `false`.

Secrets are readable back out of the cluster if they are needed again:

```sh
kubectl -n three-peaks-hub get secret three-peaks-hub-secrets \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.DB_PASSWORD}' | base64 -d
```

## The ordering problem

`data "google_compute_network_endpoint_group" "api"` reads a NEG that **GKE
creates** from the `cloud.google.com/neg` annotation on the Service. On a fresh
environment that NEG does not exist until the first deploy has run, so a single
`terraform apply` from nothing cannot succeed. It is a two-pass bootstrap.

## First-time bootstrap

0. **Let this repository authenticate to GCP.** Workload Identity bindings are
   per-repository, so until this is added every deploy fails at the auth step
   with `iam.serviceAccounts.getAccessToken denied`. This is a privilege grant
   on a shared project — read it before running it.

   ```sh
   gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
     github-actions-service@realm-construction.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
     --project=realm-construction \
     --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
     --member='principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/1085332810847/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/default-pool/attribute.repository/skylerberg/three-peaks-hub'
   ```

   Confirm it landed beside the existing repositories:

   ```sh
   gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
     github-actions-service@realm-construction.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
     --project=realm-construction
   ```

1. **Create everything the cluster does not depend on.**

   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply \
     -target=google_service_account.api \
     -target=google_service_account_iam_member.api_workload_identity \
     -target=google_storage_bucket.uploads \
     -target=google_storage_bucket_iam_member.uploads_api \
     -target=google_storage_bucket.web \
     -target=google_artifact_registry_repository.main \
     -target=google_compute_global_address.main
   ```

2. **Point DNS at the load balancer.** `threepeaksgames.com` is on **Route 53**,
   not Cloud DNS, and there is no `aws` CLI here — this is a console step.

   ```sh
   terraform output lb_ip     # A record: tools.threepeaksgames.com
   ```

   The Google-managed certificate cannot validate until this resolves.

3. **Create the database and role** on the shared Cloud SQL instance
   `master-instance` (private IP `10.122.128.3`):

   ```sql
   create role three_peaks_hub with login password '<generated>';
   create database three_peaks_hub owner three_peaks_hub;
   ```

4. **Create the namespace and its secret.** By hand, once — there is no
   sealed-secrets or external-secrets in this setup, and GCS needs no key at all
   because the pod reaches it through Workload Identity.

   ```sh
   kubectl create namespace three-peaks-hub
   kubectl -n three-peaks-hub create secret generic three-peaks-hub-secrets \
     --from-literal=DB_PASSWORD='<the password from step 3>' \
     --from-literal=PASSWORD_RESET_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
     --from-literal=REDIS_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 24)" \
     --from-literal=REDIS_URL='redis://:<the redis password>@three-peaks-hub-redis:6379'
   ```

5. **Push to `main`.** The deploy workflow builds the image, applies the base
   manifests, runs the migration Job and rolls out — and applying the Service is
   what makes GKE create `three-peaks-hub-api-neg`.

6. **Apply the rest.** The NEG now resolves, so the backend service, URL map,
   proxies and forwarding rules can be created.

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

7. **Wait for the certificate.** Up to ~20 minutes after DNS resolves.

   ```sh
   gcloud compute ssl-certificates describe three-peaks-hub-cert \
     --global --format='value(managed.status)'
   ```

## Enabling preview subdomains

Previews are served at `pr-<n>.tools.threepeaksgames.com`, which needs a
wildcard certificate. The classic Compute managed certificate cannot issue one —
its CA connects to a concrete hostname to prove control — so the wildcard comes
from Certificate Manager with a DNS-01 authorization, and attaching it is a
second apply.

1. Publish the CNAME in Route 53:

   ```sh
   terraform output wildcard_cert_dns_validation
   ```

2. Wait for `ACTIVE`. Attaching the map before this hands the HTTPS proxy a
   certificate it cannot serve:

   ```sh
   gcloud certificate-manager certificates describe three-peaks-hub-wildcard-cert \
     --location=global --format='value(managed.state)'
   ```

3. Attach it:

   ```sh
   terraform apply -var attach_wildcard_cert_map=true
   ```

4. Add a wildcard A record for `*.tools.threepeaksgames.com` pointing at the
   same `lb_ip`.

## Things that will bite

- **The node tag is hard-coded.** `local.gke_node_tag` must match the cluster's
  node pool, or health checks never reach the pods. Read it with:

  ```sh
  gcloud compute instances list --filter="name~gke-cow-cluster" \
    --format="value(tags.items)"
  ```

- **The firewall rule is deliberately separate** from critical-path's, even
  though the two overlap. GCP allows overlapping allow rules, and a
  `terraform destroy` of that stack must not silently break health checks here.

- **`terraform apply` is manual.** CI only runs `fmt -check` and `validate`; a
  plan on pull requests would need state read access and a privileged workflow.
